                    HOW MELVIN SCALES TO TERABYTES
================================================================================

NO NODE/EDGE LIMITS. NO BIG O. WAVE PROPAGATION LAWS.

brain.m can grow to TERABYTES (16 billion+ nodes)
Processing stays UNDER 100 MILLISECONDS

How? We don't scan nodes. We follow energy flow.

================================================================================
                              THE THREE LAWS
================================================================================

LAW 1: EVENT-DRIVEN PROPAGATION
    ✗ for (i = 0; i < 16_billion; i++) update(i);  ← NEVER DO THIS
    ✓ while (node = queue_get()) update(node);      ← ONLY ACTIVE NODES
    
    Result: Process 100 nodes, not billions

LAW 2: EDGE-DIRECTED TRAVERSAL
    ✗ Scan all nodes to find neighbors              ← O(N) = SLOW
    ✓ Follow linked list pointers                   ← O(degree) = FAST
    
    Result: 6 edge lookups per node, not billion-node scan

LAW 3: UEL PHYSICS (Universal Emergence Law)
    dθ/dt = -η ∇_θ F(θ; Φ(θ)) + Ξ(t)
    
    Energy flows to minimize chaos.
    Wave propagates until system settles.
    No algorithms. Just physics.
    
    Result: System determines what to compute, not Big O

================================================================================
                            THE MATH: 1TB IN 10μs
================================================================================

1TB brain.m:
  • 16,000,000,000 nodes (16 billion)
  • 50,000,000,000 edges (50 billion)
  • Total file size: ~1.3 TB

One input byte arrives:
  • Energy injected into 1 node
  • Wave propagates through ~100 nodes (NOT billions)
  • Each node: 6 edges traversed
  • Total: 100 × 6 = 600 operations
  • Time: 100 nodes × 100ns = 10 microseconds

Traditional system:
  • Must scan all 16 billion nodes
  • 16B × 100ns = 1.6 SECONDS per update
  • Doesn't scale

Melvin:
  • Only processes active nodes
  • Activity-bound, NOT size-bound
  • 10μs at 1GB or 1TB - doesn't matter

================================================================================
                        WHY THIS IS POSSIBLE: mmap()
================================================================================

brain.m is memory-mapped (mmap), not loaded into RAM:

Traditional:
  ✗ fread() entire 1TB file into RAM ← IMPOSSIBLE

Melvin:
  ✓ mmap() 1TB file (virtual address space)
  ✓ OS loads only pages we touch
  ✓ Typical: ~100 nodes × 64 bytes = 6.4KB in RAM
  ✓ Rest stays on disk

Virtual memory lets us have TB-scale address space while using KB of RAM.

================================================================================
                         THIS IS NOT BIG O
================================================================================

Big O assumes you SCAN data structures:
  • O(N) = scan all nodes
  • O(N²) = check all pairs
  • O(N log N) = sort/search

Wave propagation FOLLOWS FLOW:
  • O(active) = process what changed
  • O(degree) = follow edges
  • O(1) for most operations (pointer dereference)

It's physics, not algorithms:
  • Water doesn't check every pipe (O(N))
  • Water flows through path (O(flow))
  • Energy doesn't scan all nodes (O(N))
  • Energy propagates through wave (O(active))

================================================================================

"Traditional systems scan data structures.
 Melvin follows energy flow."

This is not a software trick. This is physics.

NO LIMITS. NO BIG O. WAVE PROPAGATION.
