EVOLUTION DIAGNOSTIC TEST SUITE
========================================

These tests use PERSISTENT .m files that build over time.
Learning should COMPOUND across runs.

For multi-run test across process boundaries:
  Phase 1: ./test_evolution_diagnostic --phase=1
  Phase 2: ./test_evolution_diagnostic --phase=2

=== RUN 1 ===
