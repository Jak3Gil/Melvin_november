LLM BASELINE (Theoretical Analysis)
====================================

Test 1: Pattern Stability & Compression
- Pattern detection: YES (via attention mechanism)
- Compression: NO (tokens remain as embeddings)
- Stable chunk: NO (no persistent memory)
- Units needed: O(sequence_length) tokens
Score: 4/10 (correct behavior, no compression)

Test 2: Locality of Activation
- Active region: ENTIRE transformer stack
- Activation: ALL layers process ALL tokens
- Bounded: NO (activation = O(sequence_length))
- Irrelevant memory: N/A (no persistent memory)
Score: 2/10 (no locality mechanism)

Test 3: Reaction to Surprise
- Response: Next-token probability changes
- Activation spread: GLOBAL (entire model)
- Prediction error: Propagates through all layers
- Localization: NO
Score: 3/10 (detects but spreads globally)

Test 4: Memory Recall Under Load
- Memory: NO persistent memory
- Retrieval: N/A (no memory to search)
- Cost: N/A
- Pattern finding: Via attention over context window
Score: 1/10 (no persistent memory)

Test 5: EXEC Function Triggering
- EXEC nodes: NO (no machine code execution)
- Activation: Pattern matching via embeddings
- Code execution: N/A
- Errors: N/A
Score: 0/10 (no EXEC mechanism)

TOTAL: 10/50
