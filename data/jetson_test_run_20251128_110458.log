MASTER TEST SUITE — 8 Core Capabilities
JETSON RUNNER
==========================================

Target: melvin@169.254.123.100
Path: /home/melvin/melvin_tests

This test suite answers:
"Is Melvin.m behaving like a real, stable, executable brain?"

The 8 capabilities tested:
1. INPUT → GRAPH → OUTPUT (No Cheating)
2. Graph-Driven Execution (No Direct C Calls)
3. Stability + Safety Under Stress
4. Correctness of Basic Tools (ADD, MUL, etc.)
5. Multi-Hop Reasoning (Chain of Tools)
6. Tool Selection (Branching Behavior)
7. Learning Tests (Co-Activity, Error Reduction)
8. Long-Run Stability (No Drift, No Corruption)
