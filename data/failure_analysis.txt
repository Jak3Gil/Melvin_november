TEST FAILURE ROOT CAUSES:
========================

1. Test 0.5.1: Learning Only Prediction Error
   ROOT CAUSE: Tests don't set prediction_error on nodes
   - No epsilon = no learning signal
   - Learning function exists but has nothing to learn from
   FIX: Tests must call melvin_set_epsilon_for_node() or 
        melvin_compute_epsilon_from_observation()

2. Test 0.8.1: Params as Nodes
   ROOT CAUSE: Tests create NEW files (0 nodes)
   - melvin.m has param nodes, but tests don't use melvin.m
   - Fresh files have no param nodes
   FIX: Tests should start from melvin.m OR call 
        melvin_inject_instincts() on new files

3. Test HARD-1: Pattern Prediction
   ROOT CAUSE: Pattern nodes not created
   - Tests create fresh files
   - Pattern nodes created by byte ingestion, but may not happen
   FIX: Ensure tests ingest bytes to create pattern nodes
        OR start from melvin.m with instinct patterns

4. Test HARD-2: Reward Shaping
   ROOT CAUSE: Reward not properly routed
   - Reward needs to reach relevant nodes
   - May need reward propagation patterns
   FIX: Use instinct reward patterns (R+HUB, R-MIX)
        OR ensure reward events reach target nodes

5. Test HARD-5: Multi-Step Reasoning
   ROOT CAUSE: Chain not strong enough or missing
   - Requires A->B->C->D chain with strong weights
   - Needs learning to strengthen chain
   FIX: Ensure chain exists, set prediction_error, 
        give enough training time

6. Test HARD-6: Adaptive Parameters
   ROOT CAUSE: Param nodes don't adapt
   - Law nodes exist but may not be connected
   - Need mechanism to update g_params from law nodes
   FIX: Ensure melvin_sync_params_from_nodes() is called
        OR law nodes are properly wired

7. Test HARD-7: Noise Robustness
   ROOT CAUSE: Learning too weak or pattern not stable
   - Noise overwhelms signal
   - Weights not strong enough
   FIX: Increase learning rate, more training iterations,
        stronger initial patterns

8. Test HARD-9: Pattern Generalization
   ROOT CAUSE: Patterns too specific, can't generalize
   - Need abstract patterns, not just concrete sequences
   FIX: Use instinct patterns as templates,
        allow graph to create variations

9. Test HARD-11: Emergent Structure
   ROOT CAUSE: No structure emerges
   - Graph may be too sparse or learning too slow
   FIX: Start with instinct scaffolding,
        increase learning rate, more time

10. Test HARD-12: Adaptive Learning Rate
    ROOT CAUSE: Learning rate doesn't adapt
    - LAW_LR_BASE node may not be connected
    - g_params not updated from law nodes
    FIX: Ensure law nodes control g_params,
         verify melvin_sync_params_from_nodes() works
