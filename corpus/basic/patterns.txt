BASIC COMPUTER PATTERNS

1. INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT
   - Read data
   - Transform it

2. FILE → READ → BYTES → PROCESS → BYTES → WRITE → FILE
   - Files contain bytes
   - Read bytes into memory
   - Process bytes
   - Write bytes back

3. SOURCE → COMPILE → MACHINE_CODE → EXECUTE
   - C source code
   - Compiler produces machine code
   - CPU executes machine code

4. SYSCALL → KERNEL → RESULT
   - User code calls syscall
   - Kernel handles it
   - Returns result

5. MEMORY → ALLOCATE → USE → FREE
   - Request memory
   - Use it
   - Release it
