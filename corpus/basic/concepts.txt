BASIC COMPUTER CONCEPTS

FILE: A sequence of bytes stored on disk
- Can be read (bytes → memory)
- Can be written (memory → bytes)
- Has a path/name

PROCESS: A running program
- Has memory space
- Can read/write files
- Can make syscalls

SYSCALL: Request to operating system
- read: get data from file/device
- write: send data to file/device
- open: open a file
- close: close a file
- exec: run a program

MEMORY: Storage for data
- malloc: allocate memory
- free: release memory
- Stack: automatic variables
- Heap: dynamic allocation

COMPILE: Convert source code to machine code
- C source → object file (.o)
- Object file contains machine code bytes
- Linker combines object files

MACHINE_CODE: Bytes that CPU executes
- Each instruction is bytes
- CPU reads bytes and executes
- Patterns in bytes = instructions
