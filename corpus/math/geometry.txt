# GEOMETRY FOUNDATION
# Shapes, angles, and spatial relationships

# Basic shapes
SHAPE → CIRCLE → AREA → PI_R_SQUARED
SHAPE → RECTANGLE → AREA → LENGTH_WIDTH
SHAPE → TRIANGLE → AREA → BASE_HEIGHT
SHAPE → SQUARE → AREA → SIDE_SQUARED

# Angles
ANGLE → MEASURE → DEGREES
ANGLE → RIGHT → NINETY_DEGREES
ANGLE → ACUTE → LESS_THAN_NINETY
ANGLE → OBTUSE → GREATER_THAN_NINETY
ANGLE → STRAIGHT → ONE_EIGHTY

# Triangles
TRIANGLE → SUM_ANGLES → ONE_EIGHTY
TRIANGLE → PYTHAGOREAN → THEOREM
TRIANGLE → SIMILAR → PROPORTIONS
TRIANGLE → CONGRUENT → SAME_SIZE

# Circles
CIRCLE → RADIUS → DIAMETER → CIRCUMFERENCE
CIRCLE → AREA → PI_R_SQUARED
CIRCLE → ARC → LENGTH
CIRCLE → SECTOR → AREA

# Coordinate geometry
POINT → COORDINATES → X_Y
LINE → SLOPE → INTERCEPT
DISTANCE → FORMULA → TWO_POINTS
MIDPOINT → FORMULA → TWO_POINTS

# Transformations
SHAPE → TRANSLATE → MOVE
SHAPE → ROTATE → TURN
SHAPE → REFLECT → MIRROR
SHAPE → DILATE → SCALE
