# COMPUTATION METHODS
# Teaching both pattern learning and EXEC computation

# Pattern Learning Approach
PATTERN → LEARN → EXAMPLES → PREDICT
EXAMPLES → PATTERN → GENERALIZE → RESULT
MANY_EXAMPLES → PATTERN_FORMATION → PREDICTION

# EXEC Computation Approach  
COMPUTE → EXEC → CPU → RESULT
NUMBER → EXEC_ADD → CPU_ADD → RESULT
DIRECT → COMPUTATION → ACCURATE → FAST

# When to Use Pattern Learning
FEW_EXAMPLES → PATTERN_LEARNING
APPROXIMATE_OK → PATTERN_LEARNING
GENERALIZATION → PATTERN_LEARNING
DISCOVERY → PATTERN_LEARNING

# When to Use EXEC Computation
EXACT_NEEDED → EXEC_COMPUTE
FAST_NEEDED → EXEC_COMPUTE
ANY_NUMBERS → EXEC_COMPUTE
RELIABLE → EXEC_COMPUTE

# Hybrid Approach
PATTERN → RECOGNIZE → EXEC → COMPUTE → RESULT
LEARN_PATTERN → TRIGGER_EXEC → CPU_COMPUTE → LEARN_RESULT
