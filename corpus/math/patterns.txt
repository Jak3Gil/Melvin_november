# MATHEMATICAL PATTERNS
# Pattern recognition and mathematical thinking

# Number patterns
SEQUENCE → PATTERN → IDENTIFY → RULE
SEQUENCE → NEXT_TERM → PREDICT
ARITHMETIC → SEQUENCE → COMMON_DIFFERENCE
GEOMETRIC → SEQUENCE → COMMON_RATIO

# Mathematical reasoning
PROBLEM → ANALYZE → STRATEGY → SOLVE
PROBLEM → BREAK_DOWN → STEPS → SOLUTION
PROOF → LOGIC → CONCLUSION
THEOREM → PROVE → STATEMENT

# Problem solving
WORD_PROBLEM → EXTRACT → INFORMATION
WORD_PROBLEM → SET_UP → EQUATION
WORD_PROBLEM → SOLVE → ANSWER
WORD_PROBLEM → CHECK → REASONABLE

# Mathematical relationships
QUANTITY → RELATE → QUANTITY
PROPORTION → RATIO → EQUAL
PERCENTAGE → FRACTION → DECIMAL
SCALE → FACTOR → MULTIPLY
