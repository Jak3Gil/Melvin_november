# CALCULUS FOUNDATION
# Limits, derivatives, and integrals

# Limits
FUNCTION → LIMIT → APPROACH → VALUE
LIMIT → X_APPROACHES → A → EVALUATE
CONTINUITY → LIMIT → EXISTS
DISCONTINUITY → LIMIT → DNE

# Derivatives
FUNCTION → DERIVATIVE → RATE_OF_CHANGE
FUNCTION → DIFFERENTIATE → DERIVATIVE
DERIVATIVE → SLOPE → TANGENT_LINE
DERIVATIVE → VELOCITY → ACCELERATION

# Derivative rules
POWER → RULE → DERIVATIVE
PRODUCT → RULE → DERIVATIVE
QUOTIENT → RULE → DERIVATIVE
CHAIN → RULE → DERIVATIVE

# Integrals
FUNCTION → INTEGRATE → ANTIDERIVATIVE
FUNCTION → INTEGRAL → AREA
DEFINITE → INTEGRAL → EVALUATE → VALUE
INDEFINITE → INTEGRAL → CONSTANT

# Integration techniques
INTEGRATION → SUBSTITUTION → METHOD
INTEGRATION → PARTS → METHOD
INTEGRATION → PARTIAL_FRACTIONS → METHOD

# Applications
DERIVATIVE → OPTIMIZATION → MAX_MIN
INTEGRAL → AREA → UNDER_CURVE
INTEGRAL → VOLUME → REVOLUTION
