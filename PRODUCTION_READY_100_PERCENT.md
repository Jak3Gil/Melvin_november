## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Start Production

```bash
# On Jetson
cd ~/melvin
./melvin_hardware_runner /mnt/melvin_ssd/melvin_brain/brain.m default default > /mnt/melvin_ssd/melvin_brain/melvin.log 2>&1 &
```

### 2. Monitor

```bash
# Check status
ps aux | grep melvin_hardware_runner

# Watch logs
tail -f /mnt/melvin_ssd/melvin_brain/melvin.log

# Check brain growth
ls -lh /mnt/melvin_ssd/melvin_brain/brain.m
```

### 3. Stop

```bash
killall melvin_hardware_runner
```
